## Overview

Engineering Mathematics (GENG 8010) is a foundational graduate course in the Master of Engineering (MEng) program at the University of Windsor. This course focuses on developing the advanced analytical skills essential for professional engineers, encompassing differential equations, difference equations, system modeling, and collaborative mathematical problem-solving.

### Course Objectives

The curriculum encompasses several key analytical and mathematical domains:
- **Differential Equations**: Mastering methods for solving first-order and higher-order linear and non-linear equations.
- **Difference Equations**: Understanding discrete-time systems and their stability analysis for engineering applications.
- **Mathematical Modeling**: Translating physical engineering problems into solvable and precise mathematical frameworks.
- **Analytical Rigor**: Developing the logical reasoning and precise calculation required for advanced engineering research.
- **Collaborative Analysis**: Leveraging modern tools and peer engagement for complex mathematical documentation.

### Repository Purpose

This repository represents a curated collection of study materials, reference books, course assessments, and personal preparation notes compiled during my academic journey. The primary motivation for creating and maintaining this archive is simple yet profound: **to preserve knowledge for continuous learning and future reference**.

As I progress in my career, I recognize that mathematical foundations remain essential for solving complex engineering problems and explaining them with technical precision. This repository serves as my intellectual reference point: a resource I can return to for relearning concepts, reviewing methodologies, and strengthening understanding when needed.

**Why this repository exists:**

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To maintain organized access to comprehensive study materials beyond the classroom
- **Continuous Learning**: To support lifelong learning by enabling easy revisitation of fundamental mathematical principles
- **Academic Documentation**: To authentically document my learning journey through Engineering Mathematics
- **Community Contribution**: To share these resources with students and learners who may benefit from them

> [!NOTE]
