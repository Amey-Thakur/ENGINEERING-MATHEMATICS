     ========================================================================================= -->
## Overview

Engineering Mathematics (GENG 8010) is a cornerstone graduate course in the Master of Engineering (MEng) program at the University of Windsor. This course provides the rigorous mathematical foundation necessary for advanced engineering analysis, focusing on differential equations, difference equations, and their applications in modeling complex physical systems.

### Course Objectives

The curriculum encompasses critical mathematical domains for engineering researchers:
- **Differential Equations**: Mastering methods for solving first-order and higher-order linear and non-linear equations.
- **Difference Equations**: Understanding discrete-time systems and their stability analysis.
- **Mathematical Modeling**: Translating physical engineering problems into solvable mathematical frameworks.
- **Analytical Rigor**: Developing the precise logical reasoning required for advanced engineering research.

### Repository Purpose

This repository represents a curated collection of study materials, reference books, course assessments, and personal preparation notes compiled during my academic journey. The primary motivation for this archive is to preserve high-fidelity academic records for continuous learning and future engineering applications.

As mathematical foundations are the language of engineering, this repository serves as a permanent reference point for reviewing complex methodologies and strengthening analytical understanding when solving real-world engineering challenges.

**Why this repository exists:**

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To maintain organized access to comprehensive mathematical materials beyond the semester.
- **Continuous Learning**: To support lifelong learning by enabling easy revisitation of fundamental engineering mathematics.
- **Academic Documentation**: To authentically document my progress through the MEng Engineering Mathematics curriculum.
- **Community Contribution**: To share these resources with students and learners pursuing graduate-level engineering.

> [!NOTE]
> All materials were created, compiled, and organized by me during the Winter 2023 semester as part of my MEng degree requirements.
